  <h2>My Educational Journey</h2>
  <p>I was born and raised in Compton California, and honestly, I just went with the flow. I previously went to school at Emerson Elementary, transitioned into Roosevelt Middle School, and then finally Dominguez High School. I began to take school seriously during high school. I strived for good grades but had no idea what I wanted to do as a career path. Through the years I found interests in computers, music, and creative writing. </p>
